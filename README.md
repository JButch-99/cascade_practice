## Description

_This is an fictional webpage meant to practice the use of CSS and cascading styles for HTML / CSS applications. On the left side of the screen, there will be 3 false animal profiles. This being David the rabbit, Sherry the cat, and Eli the dog. These 3 profiles are meant to represent the new additions this shelter would've had. It will display attributes for each respective animal, their age, a photo of them, and other information regarding them. The rightmost side of the screen will display 4 false links. Rather than redirect you to a section for this website, it will instead send you to a Youtube video as a small gag. Below is the mission statement for the organization and what their intent is._
